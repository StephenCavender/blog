I'm a [believer](https://nspire.church), husband, father, [stoic](http://aom.is/stoic), [developer](https://github.com/StephenCavender), gamer, guitarist, and [crossfitter](http://bbzwestfield.com). I'm a software engineer at [Genesys](https://genesys.com) but this blog, its content, and opinions are my own.

### About this Site
I'm blogging to help strengthen my understandings of various topics and to engage with the community. I'll write about technologies I use and/or am interested in.

My name is Stephen Cavender. I'm a [believer](https://nspire.church), husband, [stoic](http://aom.is/stoic), [programmer](https://github.com/StephenCavender), gamer, guitarist, and [crossfitter](http://bbzwestfield.com). I'm a software engineer at [Genesys](https://genesys.com) but this blog, its content and opinions are my own.

### About this Site
I'm blogging to engage with the community. I want to be a part of a community that seeks to help each other and share what we've learned. I'll write about technologies that I use and am interested in, gaming, and every once in a while about life in general.
